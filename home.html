            Hi! I'm a sophomore at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> concentrating in Computer Science. I don't like
            using labels to put myself, and others, in these tiny boxes that cannot even begin to describe who we are, but if I had to pick a few to describe
            my role in the projects I have worked on, and the fields I am passionate about and interested in working in, then it would be - Developer, Designer, 
            Engineer, Thinker.
            <br> <br>
            The one thing that separates us, from every other living creature, is creativity and original thought. It is integral to who we are and I believe that it
            is a key part of bringing us satisfaction from the work we do, but how does one attempt to understand a concept that is so uniquely human? I tried my hand 
            at everything from Sports to Math to Molecular Biology to Religion. I didn't know what I was searching for but I knew it had to do with finding satisfaction in
            the work I do. This search followed me as I started college, and as I finish my first year I think I see the light at the end of the tunnel. 
            <br> <br>
            The ability to create, to make something and be able to share it with the world - that is what I was searching for. The ability to transcend what's right in front of us, 
            to be able to find our way through an ever expanding sea of analysis, opinions and ideas and truly change a mind or situation for the better. The ability to create something 
            tangible, something that can impact people's lives, from nothing, excited me unlike anything I had done so far.
            <br> <br>
            I think technology and software is particularly wonderful because it is a tool with which we can create something that can impact the greatest number of people in the shortest
            amount of time - the much coveted top-left corner of the impact-effort matrix. I hope to use my background and education in software and technology to build products and organizations
            that solve problems and help people. 
        </p>
