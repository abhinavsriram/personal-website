            Hi! I'm a senior at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brown.edu/">Brown University</a> concentrating in <a target="_blank" href="https://cs.brown.edu">Computer Science</a>.
            I don't like using labels to put myself (and others) in tiny boxes that cannot even begin to describe who we are, but if I had to pick a few to describe
            my role in the projects I have worked on, I think that "Developer, Designer, Engineer, and Thinker" would do the best job.
            I will now try my best to summarize my journey in a way that captures what I believe in, stand for and am passionate about.
            <br> <br>
            The one thing that separates us, from every other living creature, is creativity and original thought. It is integral to who we are and to bringing us satisfaction
            from the work we do, but how does one attempt to understand a concept that is so uniquely human? I tried my hand at everything from Sports to Math to Molecular Biology to Religion.
            I didn't know exactly what I was searching for but I knew it had to do with finding satisfaction in the work I do and finding something I am passionate about that epitomizes creativity
            and original thought. This search followed me as I started college, and at the end of my first year, I felt like technology and software were the avenues I was looking for.
            <br> <br>
            The ability to create, to make something and be able to share it with the world. The ability to transcend what's right in front of us,
            to be able to find our way through an ever expanding sea of analysis, opinions and ideas and truly change a mind or situation for the better.
            The ability to create something tangible, something that can impact people's lives, from nothing, excited me unlike anything I had done so far.
            <br> <br>
            I think technology and software are wonderful because it is a tool with which we can create something that can impact the greatest number of people in the shortest
            amount of time - the much coveted top-left corner of the impact-effort matrix.
            I hope that my experiences and education will better inform my ability to build products and organizations that solve problems, help people and make a difference.
            <br> <br>
            To that end, I've previously worked in a variety of product and engineering roles
            at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a>, specifically at <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Azure</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-firewall/">Cloud Security</a>,
            at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amgineink.com">amginE Ink</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.u4eaapp.com">U4Ea</a> in the mental health and wellness space,
            at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fujielectric.com">Fuji Electric</a> on a consumer electronics product, and
            at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.almamatters.io/about-us/">Alma Matters</a> in the education space.
            Some of the advanced coursework I've taken,
            in areas I'm particularly interested in, include
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1380/">Distributed Systems</a>,
            <a target="_blank" href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs1951l/">Blockchains & Cryptocurrencies</a>,
            <a target="_blank" href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1730/">Programming Languages</a>,
            <a target="_blank" href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1710/">Formal Methods</a>, and
            <a target="_blank" href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1410/">Artificial Intelligence</a>.
            If any of my past work (professional or academic) interests you as well, please feel free to reach out to chat or grab coffee.
            I’ve recently been especially interested in, and am bullish on, blockchains, crypto and web3, and love meeting people in the space.
            <br> <br>
            I have also not updated this website in a while which is why it only has a link to my resume at the moment.
