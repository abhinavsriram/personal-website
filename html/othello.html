        <span class="heading">Introduction</span> <br><br>
        The game of Othello is played on an 8 by 8 grid of board spaces.
        The game pieces (chips) are black on one side and white on the other.
        Each player is assigned a color. They take turns placing tiles on the board with the player's color face up.
        The object of the game is to have the most tiles of your color on the board when the game is over.
        You can flip your opponent's tiles from their color to your color by "sandwiching" them. A valid move must sandwich at least one of your opponent’s tiles.

        <span class="heading">How To Play</span> <br><br>
        <span class="sub-heading">Human vs Human</span> <br>
        As described in the introduction, the game is played by two players, each of whom is assigned a color - white or black.
        The 2 players can choose their respective colors using the radio-buttons.
        By default, the first turn goes to the player assigned white.
        After the players choose their respective colors and hit Apply Settings, the game begins and the users will be met by the screen below.
        The banner on top of the game board informs users of whose turn it is and the banner below the game board lets users know the
        score (as determined by the number of pieces on the board).
        To make things easier for human players, all possible valid moves are highlighted by gray squares.
        If a user cannot make a valid move, their turn is automatically skipped and the banner on top of the game board indicates whose move it is.
        If both players cannot make a valid move or if the board is full, the banner on top of the game board indicates that the game is over and the one below, indicates the winner.

        <span class="sub-heading">Human vs Computer</span> <br>
        The Human player chooses their color as usual and chooses their opponent to be the computer player of level 1, 2, or 3.
        The game progresses as shown below. The computer player always makes their move with a small delay so that their moves are actually observable.
